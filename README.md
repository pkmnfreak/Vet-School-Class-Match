An application where users can input classes they've taken and the system will order a list of vet schools based on how close they are to meeting all of the prerequisites

Using the Devise gem to create the user system, Vet School Class Match automatically orders veterinary schools by how many more units the user needs to take to fulfill the prerequisites.

The user can also see a list of potential schools and what classes they require in alphabetical order in the Schools tab.
